The symptoms of immunodeficiencies can vary substantially between individuals , even when they have defects in the same gene . For example , only some of the individuals who have defects in both of their copies of a gene called HOIL-1\u2014which has been linked to several roles in the body's immune response\u2014are reported to suffer from an altered susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic ( persistent ) inflammation .

MacDuff et al . studied mice that had mutations in both copies of the mouse equivalent of the HOIL-1 gene . These mice , when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses , were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites , including Listeria monocytogenes .

The immunodeficiency to L . monocytogenes was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines , which form a crucial part of the immune response .

Mice with two other distinct genetic deficiencies that affect their immune system were also better able to survive otherwise lethal bacterial infections if they had a long-term herpesvirus infection . Macduff et al . suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system , and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies , including those caused by mutations in the HOIL-1 gene . This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency .

People affected by the disease find that their muscles become progressively weaker , and may go on to develop a bone disorder and a form of dementia . The disease is caused by mutations in a gene that codes for Valosin-Containing Protein ( VCP ) \u2013 a protein that carries out many different roles in cells . Mutated forms of VCP predominantly affect tissues and organs that need a lot of energy , such as the muscles and the brain . Within cells , structures called mitochondria generate energy . A number of studies suggest that the mitochondria in cells taken from individuals with IBMPFD do not generate energy properly . However , it is not known how mutant VCP disrupts mitochondria or how this leads to disease . Fruit flies and humans have similar versions of the gene that produces VCP . Studying flies that have mutations that affect the gene can therefore help researchers to understand how these mutations might affect humans . Zhang et al . have now engineered fruit flies whose muscle cells made a mutant form of VCP . These flies showed many of the symptoms of IBMPFD ( such as the death of muscle cells ) . In addition , the mitochondria in the muscle cells were smaller and more fragmented than normal . This led Zhang et al . to look at a protein called Mitofusin that controls how mitochondria fuse . VCP normally degrades Mitofusin; the mutant form of VCP caused Mitofusin to degrade excessively . This resulted in mitochondria experiencing reduced levels of fusion , leading to cell malfunction and death . In further experiments , Zhang et al . treated the disease-modeled flies and cells from human patients with IBMPFD with inhibitor drugs that prevent the activity of VCP . This treatment reversed the defects that affected the mitochondria and prevented the death of muscle cells . This opens up the possibility of using VCP inhibitors \u2013 which are already being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for cancer \u2013 as drugs to treat IBMPFD .",

Zhang et al . have now engineered fruit flies whose muscle cells made a mutant form of VCP . These flies showed many of the symptoms of IBMPFD ( such as the death of muscle cells ) . In addition , the mitochondria in the muscle cells were smaller and more fragmented than normal . This led Zhang et al . to look at a protein called Mitofusin that controls how mitochondria fuse . VCP normally degrades Mitofusin; the mutant form of VCP caused Mitofusin to degrade excessively . This resulted in mitochondria experiencing reduced levels of fusion , leading to cell malfunction and death . In further experiments , Zhang et al . treated the disease-modeled flies and cells from human patients with IBMPFD with inhibitor drugs that prevent the activity of VCP . This treatment reversed the defects that affected the mitochondria and prevented the death of muscle cells . This opens up the possibility of using VCP inhibitors \u2013 which are already being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for cancer \u2013 as drugs to treat IBMPFD .",

But what happens when the visibility decreases as you look further into the distance , as happens when driving in fog ? Fortunately , as new research reveals , people tend to overestimate their speed when driving in fog-like conditions , and show a natural tendency to drive at a slower pace . Pretto et al . performed a series of experiments involving experienced drivers and high-quality virtual reality simulations . In one experiment , drivers were presented with two driving scenes and asked to guess which scene was moving faster . In the reference scene , the car was driving at a fixed speed through a landscape under conditions of clear visibility; in the test scene , it was moving through the same landscape , again at a fixed speed , but with the visibility reduced in different ways . The experiments showed that drivers overestimated speeds in fog-like conditions , and they underestimated speeds when the reduction in visibility did not depend on distance . Further experiments confirmed that these perceptions had an influence on driving behaviour: drivers recorded an average speed of 85 . 1 km/hr when the visibility was good , and this dropped to 70 . 9 km/hr in severe fog . However , when visibility was reduced equally at all distances , as happens with a fogged up windshield , the average driving speed increased to 101 . 3 km/hr . Based on previous work , Pretto et al . developed the theory that the perception of speed is influenced by the relative speeds of the visible regions in the scene . When looking directly into the fog , visibility is strongly reduced in the distant regions , where the relative motion is slow , and is preserved in the near regions , where the motion is fast . This visibility gradient would lead to speed overestimation . To test this theory , the experiments were repeated with new drivers under three different conditions: good visibility , fog , and an artificial situation called \u2018anti-fog\u2019 in which visibility is poor in the near regions and improves as the driver looks further into the distance . As predicted , the estimated speed was lower in anti-fog than in clear visibility and fog . Conversely , the driving speed was 104 . 4 km/hr in anti-fog compared with 67 . 9 km/hr in good visibility and 51 . 3 km/hr in fog . Overall , the results show that the perception of speed is influenced by spatial variations in visibility , and they strongly suggest that this is due to the relative speed contrast between the visible and covert areas within the scene .",

The experiments also show that some key genes are switched on in a new cell type that might produce signals to support regeneration . Lastly , Roberts-Galbraith et al . found that the planarian nervous system contains cells called glia . Previous studies have shown that many of the cells in the human brain are glia and that these cells help nerve cells to survive and work properly . The discovery of glia in planarians means that it will be possible to use these worms to study how glia support brain regeneration and how glia themselves are replaced after injury . In the long term , this work might lead to discoveries that shed light on how tissue regeneration could be improved in humans .",

Next , the H3N2 influenza strain was grown in these different conditions for nearly 200 generations and sequenced to determine how the virus evolved in each distinctive host chaperone environment . Phillips et al . discovered that host chaperones affect the rate at which mutations accumulate in the influenza population , and also the types of mutations in the influenza genome .

Moreover , whether chaperones will promote or hinder the effects of any single mutation is difficult to predict ahead of time . This discovery is significant , as the chaperones available to influenza can vary in different tissues , organisms and infectious conditions , and may therefore influence the virus' ability to change and evolve in a context-specific manner . The findings are likely to extend to other viruses such as HIV and Ebola , which also hijack host chaperones for the same purpose . More work is now needed to systematically quantify these effects so that we can better predict how specific chaperones will affect the ability of viruses to adapt , especially in pathologically relevant conditions like fever or viral host-switching .

However , it is poorly understood how these forces create patterns of cell size and shape across a tissue . Here , Dye , Popovic et al . combined experiments with physical models to examine how cells acquire these physical characteristics across the developing wing of fruit fly larvae . This revealed that cells pushing and pulling on one another create forces that trigger internal biochemical reorganization \u2013 for instance , force-generating structures become asymmetrical . In turn , the cells exert additional forces on their neighbors , setting up a positive feedback loop which results in cells adopting the right size and shape across the organ . As such , cells in the fly wing can spontaneously self-organize through the interplay of mechanical and biochemical signals , without the need for pre-existing morphogen gradients . A refined understanding of how physical forces shape cells and organs would help to grasp how defects can emerge during development . This knowledge would also allow scientists to better grow tissues and organs in the laboratory , both for theoretical research and regenerative medicine .",

Mitochondria constantly divide ( a process known as fission ) or fuse together , which helps to keep them in good working condition and well distributed around the cell . Several neurological disorders , including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s , are associated with problems that affect mitochondrial fission . Many different molecules work together to help mitochondria divide , including a protein called Drp1 . A number of Drp1 molecules can associate with each other to form an \u201coligomer\u201d in the shape of a ring around a mitochondrion . The ring then constricts to split the mitochondrion in two .

Mitochondria constantly divide ( a process known as fission ) or fuse together , which helps to keep them in good working condition and well distributed around the cell . Several neurological disorders , including Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s , are associated with problems that affect mitochondrial fission . Many different molecules work together to help mitochondria divide , including a protein called Drp1 . A number of Drp1 molecules can associate with each other to form an \u201coligomer\u201d in the shape of a ring around a mitochondrion . The ring then constricts to split the mitochondrion in two .

We would prefer eating a given taste if it did not cause any negative feelings after eating it for the first time; however , we would avoid eating that specific taste if it caused any digestive discomfort . This ability to connect sensory events that happen close in time is called associative learning . One longstanding theory of associative learning suggests that if the neurons that are activated by a taste fire at the same time as those that control nausea , the connections between the two groups of neurons are strengthened . This helps that particular taste to become associated with the feeling of illness . Animals can also link events that are separated in time \u2013 for example , they can become averse to a food even when its ill effects are felt several hours after eating it . An important question is how a new event ( such as a new food ) is internally represented and maintained for a certain time so that it associates with a response ( sickness ) that occurs much later . One method used to investigate associative learning is to feed rats a new food , and then later make them feel nauseous to measure how much this causes them to avoid the food in the future . The gustatory cortex is the part of the brain responsible for perceiving taste . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum now use this experimental method to investigate the molecular mechanisms in the gustatory cortex that enable the internal representation ( or memory trace ) of a new taste to be associated with an unwell feeling that occurs much later . The results of the experiments show that rats will avoid food with a certain flavor if they feel unwell within eight hours of eating it . However , the response of the rats differs depending on when the rat becomes ill . Underpinning these behaviors is the formation of two parallel internal representations of the new taste: a short-term , robust trace that lasts for three hours; and a parallel , longer lasting , weaker trace that lasts for eight hours to associate the taste with its outcome . The weaker , longer-lasting memory trace only forms if the shorter , stronger trace also occurs . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum found that forming the shorter , stronger memory requires the activity of a signaling pathway in the gustatory cortex that involves biochemical molecules called NMDAR-CaMKII-GluA1 . These molecules can increase the strength of signaling between neurons and are already implicated in learning and memory . The next challenge is to put this newly identified molecular mechanism within the relevant neural circuit in the gustatory cortex .",

The gustatory cortex is the part of the brain responsible for perceiving taste . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum now use this experimental method to investigate the molecular mechanisms in the gustatory cortex that enable the internal representation ( or memory trace ) of a new taste to be associated with an unwell feeling that occurs much later . The results of the experiments show that rats will avoid food with a certain flavor if they feel unwell within eight hours of eating it . However , the response of the rats differs depending on when the rat becomes ill . Underpinning these behaviors is the formation of two parallel internal representations of the new taste: a short-term , robust trace that lasts for three hours; and a parallel , longer lasting , weaker trace that lasts for eight hours to associate the taste with its outcome . The weaker , longer-lasting memory trace only forms if the shorter , stronger trace also occurs . Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum found that forming the shorter , stronger memory requires the activity of a signaling pathway in the gustatory cortex that involves biochemical molecules called NMDAR-CaMKII-GluA1 . These molecules can increase the strength of signaling between neurons and are already implicated in learning and memory . The next challenge is to put this newly identified molecular mechanism within the relevant neural circuit in the gustatory cortex .",

When genes are active , copies of the DNA are made using molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) and these can then be used as templates to make proteins . One way genes can be controlled is by adding small chemical tags that mark them out to be activated or deactivated , known as epigenetic control . The muscle disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( FSHD ) is caused by the loss of the chemical tags that normally keep certain genes switched off in many cell types . One of these genes is DUX4 , which in healthy males is normally only active in the testes , but in FSHD patients it is also active in other parts of the body . Another way to control genes is by nonsense-mediated decay , where incorrect or incomplete RNA molecules are destroyed before they can be used to make defective proteins . In this study , Feng et al . show that when DUX4 is activated following the failure of epigenetic control in FSHD patients , the effectiveness of nonsense-mediated decay is also reduced . This results in the build-up of incorrect RNA molecules inside muscle cells , which can harm the cell . In fact , 13% of the incorrect RNA molecules that are normally destroyed in cells were found at higher levels when DUX4 was active . To investigate how DUX4 could work , Feng et al . focused on another gene called UPF1 because cells without the protein encoded by this gene have similar defects in nonsense-mediated decay as cells with active DUX4 . No difference was found in how often the UPF1 gene is activated in FSHD cells and normal cells . However , the amount of the protein encoded by UPF1 was lower in cells with FSHD than in normal muscle cells . The experiments show that the protein encoded by UPF1 is broken down as a result of the activation of the DUX4 gene , leading to problems with nonsense-mediated decay , which may result in the worsening of FSHD symptoms . The twist in the tale is that DUX4 itself is also controlled by nonsense-mediated decay under normal circumstances . Therefore , in diseased cells , a failure in epigenetic control allows DUX4 to prevent its own destruction by tampering with nonsense-mediated decay .

Calhoun et al . show that in extreme conditions , such as when food is completely removed , the animals determine where and for how long to persist with their search based on their knowledge of what was typical of their environment . Such a strategy is called infotaxis , which literally means \u2018guided by information\u2019 . While the neural circuits underpinning these behaviors remain to be found , Calhoun et al . propose a model that suggests that these circuits could be relatively simple , and made up of as few as three neurons .",

The classical view suggests that the positioning of each new leaf or flower bud at the tip of a growing stem is based on a small set of principles . This includes the idea that buds produce inhibitory signals that prevent other buds from forming too close to each other . When computational models of phyllotaxis follow these \u2018deterministic\u2019 principles , they are able to recreate the spiral pattern the buds form on a growing stem .

When macrophages and microglia were depleted from the zebrafish larvae , the nerve cells with the mutant protein grew less well , supporting the idea that the immune cells enhance the development of early tumors . A better understanding of how tumor cells and immune cells interact in the brain may help in the search for new anti-cancer drugs . Furthermore , the way in which macrophages and microglia are recruited to the tumor cells could be similar when tumors return after treatment . Future studies will test this hypothesis and , if it proves true , interfering with the macrophage and microglia response might delay the relapse of tumors .",

A complex machinery inside the cell then uses the copy as a template to assemble the protein . So-called transcription factors ( also proteins ) can switch the copying process on or off by binding to the start point of a gene . They can act alone or in complex with other proteins . The transcription factor called ASCIZ , for example , helps to regulate the production of a protein called LC8 . LC8 attaches to more than 100 different proteins and plays an important role in many cell processes . Therefore , fine-tuning its production is essential . The shape of a protein is critical to its purpose . Like most proteins , transcription factors are made up of chains of amino acids that fold into a specific three-dimensional ( 3D ) structurewith a region that recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence . But many transcription factors also contain flexible , \u2018disordered\u2019 regions that do not fold into a rigid 3D shape . These may help to control the activity of genes , but their exact role is unclear . ASCIZ contains an exceptionally long , disordered region that has multiple positions for binding LC8 along its chain .

To address this question , Clark et al . combined biophysical , structural and molecular biology techniques to analyze proteins from humans and fruit flies and to test their role in human cells . This revealed that LC8 and ASCIZ form a dynamic mixture of complexes , instead of a single fully-occupied complex . As the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ increased , the rate of transcription dropped . However , all of the binding sites were rarely fully occupied . Instead , three to four attached LC8 molecules seemed to be sufficient to ensure that LC8 levels remain balanced . When the number of LC8 molecules exceeded this value , the attachment rate for additional LC8 slowed down . So , even when there was an excess of LC8 , most of the human ASCIZ binding sites were only partially filled . This way , the production of LC8 proteins was slowed , rather than fully shut down . As a result , the cells were able to fine-tune the transcription rate of LC8 and maintain a stable and balanced pool of these proteins .

This made it possible to develop a three-dimensional model of the ATP synthase in its autoinhibited form . The structural data could also be split into three distinct shapes that relate to dwell points in the rotation of the motor where the rotation has been inhibited . These models further our understanding of ATP synthases and provide a template to understand the findings of previous studies . Further work will be needed to understand this essential biological process at the atomic level in both its inhibited and uninhibited form . This will reveal the inner workings of a marvel of the natural world and may also lead to the discovery of new antibiotics against related bacteria that cause diseases in humans .",

    "reference": "Working memory is the brain\u2019s ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information . It is essential for carrying out complex cognitive tasks , such as reasoning , planning , following instructions or solving problems . Unlike long-term memory , information is not stored and recalled , but held in an accessible state for brief periods . However , the capacity of working memory is very limited . Humans , for example , can only hold around four items of information simultaneously . There are various competing theories about how this limitation arises from the network of neurons in the brain . These models are based on studies of humans and other primates . But memory limitations are not exclusive to mammals . Indeed , the working memory of some birds , such as crows , has a similar capacity to humans despite the architecture of their brains being very different to mammals . So , how do brains with such distinct structural differences produce working memories with similar capacities ? To investigate , Hahn et al . probed the working memory of carrion crows in a change detection task developed for macaque monkeys . Crows were trained to memorize varying numbers of colored squares and indicate which square had changed after a one second delay when the screen went blank .

    "generated_caption": "Working memory is the brain\u2019s ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information . It is essential for carrying out complex cognitive tasks , such as reasoning , planning , following instructions or solving problems . Unlike long-term memory , information is not stored and recalled , but held in an accessible state for brief periods . However , the capacity of working memory is very limited . Humans , for example , can only hold around four items of information simultaneously . There are various competing theories about how this limitation arises from the network of neurons in the brain . These models are based on studies of humans and other primates . But memory limitations are not exclusive to mammals . Indeed , the working memory of some birds , such as crows , has a similar capacity to humans despite the architecture of their brains being very different to mammals . So , how do brains with such distinct structural differences produce working memories with similar capacities ? To investigate , Hahn et al . probed the working memory of carrion crows in a change detection task developed for macaque monkeys . Crows were trained to memorize varying numbers of colored squares and indicate which square had changed after a one second delay when the screen went blank .

Once in human blood , the parasites rapidly multiply . People who live in countries where malaria is common may become infected and never show any symptoms because their immune systems are able to keep parasite numbers low . Repeated infections , or infection with more than one species of malaria parasite also are common . Some species of malaria , including Plasmodium vivax , can hibernate in the liver for weeks or months after the infection and only become active later . Asymptomatic infections , multi-parasite infections , and reactivating parasites make it hard to measure how often new malaria infections occur . One way scientists can determine if a new infection has occurred is by genotyping the parasites in a person\u2019s blood . Genotyping involves looking for small differences in the parasite DNA . For example , a study in Papua New Guinea , where P . vivax is very common , showed that reactivations of hibernating parasites were more common than new infections . Now , Hofmann et al . use the same study in Papua New Guinea to compare the frequency and consequences of new infections with P . vivax and another malaria parasite , Plasmodium falciparum . In the study , 466 children from 6 villages were followed for 8 months with tests every 2 to 4 weeks to genotype the parasites in their blood . Some of the children were treated with antimalarial drugs to help wipe out any existing parasites including hibernating ones . While P . vivax was about twice as common in blood samples\u2014likely due to reactivation\u2014genotyping showed that new infections with the two parasites occur at equal rates and often at the same times and locations . Hofmann et al . also showed that some villages and some children had much higher rates of infection than others . This difference could not fully be explained by use of bednets or other preventive measures . Children were more likely to become ill from P . falciparum than P . vivax even though P . vivax was more common . But children with more frequent infections with P . falciparum seemed better able to manage the parasites and were less likely to develop symptoms that those with infrequent infections . The experiments show that genotyping may help scientists better track new malaria infections and develop better strategies to prevent or treat malaria .",
